This is my website to demonstrate my diverse skills and work experience.
---
- The website is developed by me using ReactJS front-end library, and hosted on Netlify platform.
- The database is used for this is Firebase/Firestore (Backend-as-a-Service) of Google Cloud Platform.
- Demonstrated various components of UI/UX design for the frontend during the project like forms, tabels, cards, carousel, accordions, image/file rendering and sending emails.
- The website is tailored for the desktop enviromnent, however it is responsive for mobile, and other devices as well.
- I developed 4 mini-projects along the way to learn ReactJS, experiment with different features like carousel, pdf-rendering, sending emails, connecting to database to fetch the data.
- Containorized the app using docker, and image is available on the DockerHub.
- I utilized chatGPT to improve the grammar, and sentence structure, for debugging and learning purpose to implement some features.
